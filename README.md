# Project
This project was an attempt at using computer science and historical sports data to gamble on daily fantasy sports.

This was just a fun side-project. A lot is going on to make this work. It was sometimes successful but mostly would have me breaking-even. The missing piece is probably switching to an AI model or use more sophisticated statistics. Don't take this too seriously, it was just for me to play around with so ignore the spaghetti.

# Documentation

Sphinx auto generated docs with "read-the-docs" theme.

```
make build_docs

# Contributing

Feel free, *but*:

### Branching

 - Don't make random branches
 - If you are just experimenting then do so in a branch "play/your_name"
 - If you're working on a feature then "feature/feature_name"
 - If you are working on a defect, then "defect/defect_name"
 - If you are working on multiple defects at once and only want to make a single PR then "defect/champions"

### PRs
 - Rebase your commits to something neat.
 - Try to reference the issue in your commit e.g. "closes #15"

Feel free, BUT:

### Branching

 - Don't make random branches
 - If you are just experimenting then do so in a branch "play/your_name"
 - If you're working on a feature then "feature/feature_name"
 - If you are working on a defect, then "defect/defect_name"
 - If you are working on multiple defects at once and only want to make a single PR then "defect/champions"
